## Sygma Cross-chain Escrow

This is a work in progress example of cross-chain escrow implementation using Sygma SDK and Solidity.

Purpose of this project is to abstract the logic of switching between different chains and having fragmented liquidity between them.

Functionality:
- This is an ongoing example showcasing the implementation of a cross-chain escrow mechanism using the Sygma SDK and Solidity. The main objective of this project is to provide new solution for abstracting the logic associated with seamless transitions between different blockchain networks. By doing so, the project aims to address the challenge of managing fragmented liquidity across diverse blockchain ecosystems.


The project is designed to facilitate cross-chain escrow actions, allowing users to securely transact assets across different blockchain networks. This includes the seamless transfer and management of funds between disparate blockchain environments.
